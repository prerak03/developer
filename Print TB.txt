/*
Objective(s) -
-	This code demonstrates the basic programmable configuration report
-	This code prints a Trial Balance Report without bringing up the Print Configuration
	Screen since Configuration details are preset in the Function

Syntax -
-	There is an enhancement in syntax of Print, Export, Upload and Mail Actions
-	They are changed to accept an additional logical parameter.
	-	If set to Yes, then these actions get carried out silently.
	-	If set to No, the behavior is similar to previous wherein the configuration screen
		is displayed to accept various parameters
-	<Action>	: <Report Name>	: <Logical Value>
-	E.g., Mail	: Trial Balance	: Yes which means all the required configurations like
	SMTP Details, From Address, etc. are set sequentially within the Function before requesting
	for this action.

Last Modification -
-	Altered on 23-01-2010

Specification(s) -
-	Configuration for PrinterName in this code is set to 'SnagIt 7'. It must be altered as
	required
