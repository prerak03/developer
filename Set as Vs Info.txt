/*
Objective(s) -
-	This code demonstrates the difference between Set As and Info and the precedence
-	The attributes Set as and Info are treated as same attribute with aliases, when
	'Info' is used, it had a special 'Skip' and 'Prompt' privilege. If both are 
	specified the Attribute 'Info' takes higher precedence than 'Set As'.
